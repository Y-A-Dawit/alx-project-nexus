# Project Nexus – ProDev Backend Engineering Learnings

## Overview of the ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The **ProDev Backend Engineering program** focuses on building strong foundations in backend software development.  
Learners gain hands-on experience in designing and building scalable APIs, managing databases, implementing asynchronous tasks, and deploying production-ready applications.  
The program emphasizes industry best practices, collaboration, and real-world problem solving.

---

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered

- **Python** – primary programming language for backend development.
- **Django** – high-level framework for building APIs and applications.
- **REST APIs** – design principles, implementation, versioning, and documentation.
- **GraphQL** – flexible query language for efficient data fetching.
- **Docker** – containerization for consistent development and deployment.
- **CI/CD** – continuous integration and delivery pipelines for automation.

---

### Important Backend Development Concepts

- **Database Design** – schema normalization, indexing, query optimization, and migrations.
- **Asynchronous Programming** – background tasks and message queues using Celery & RabbitMQ.
- **Caching Strategies** – in-memory caches (Redis), HTTP caching, and cache invalidation patterns.

---

### Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Complex Database Queries**: Optimized queries with indexing and denormalization where appropriate.  
- **Asynchronous Task Failures**: Implemented retries, error logging, and monitoring for Celery tasks.  
- **API Versioning Issues**: Adopted clear versioning strategy (e.g., `/api/v1/`) and maintained backward compatibility.  
- **Environment Differences ("Works on my machine" problem)**: Solved with Docker containers and `.env` configuration.  

---

### Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

- Write **clean, modular, and well-documented code**.  
- Always **document APIs** (Swagger/OpenAPI for REST, schema docs for GraphQL).  
- Automate testing and linting using **CI/CD pipelines**.  
- **Keep secrets out of source control** (use environment variables).  
- Optimize **database queries and caching** early for scalability.  
- Collaboration with frontend learners ensures **seamless integration** of APIs.
